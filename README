-- Technology and Requirements --

Pyrostia is based on PHP and MySQL so your server must have these installed. The minimum PHP version required is 5.0, and the minimum MySQL version required is also 5.0.

Pyrostia also uses jQuery and Knockout.js to power modern interactive user-interface and to reduce server-side load.

-- Install --
In the first version installation is manual and requires the following steps:

1. Create a database for Pyrostia
2. Open inc/mysql_wrapper.inc.php and edit the database details on lines 10-13
3. Import pyrostia.sql file into the created database in the first step.
4. Run the following query:

INSERT INTO `pyr_settings` (`name`, `value`) VALUES ('site_url', 'YOUR INSTALLATION URL HERE');

But first replace "YOUR INSTALLATION URL HERE" with the URL where you have installed the software. Make sure the trailing slash IS INCLUDED.

5. That's it, you can register yourself and/or let your website users register themselves and use the menu planner.
	

-- Modify The Design --

Pyrostia UI is built with HTML5 and uses mostly CSS based design. To modify the CSS you need to edit the file <b>css/screen.css</b>, and to modify the HTML code you need to carefully edit the files in "views" folder. The layout is in master.html and the other files present partial views.
